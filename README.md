# ðŸš€ðŸš€ Gundam Evolution Challenges ðŸš€ðŸš€
> If any challenge types, units, or unit groups are missing please create an issue so I can add them in.

This simple application is a stand-in for Gundam Evolution's challenges system which, as of right now, is only accessible between matches. This makes it hard to know which challenges you have left and for which units. Now with this app you can just open a second monitor or alt tab and keep track of the challenges you would like to work on. All of your data is stored locally to your computer so you do not need to create an account or anything like that.

## Usage
Using this app is meant to be as simple as possible.
1. Clone the repo or navigate to the public URL
2. Add your daily and weekly challenges
    * Select the challenge type (kills, wins, etc.), amount (# of kills etc.), and the group of units. You can add additional unit groups if necessary. Please let me know if there are any missing and I will add them ASAP.
3. Update your progress on the app as you make progress in the game
4. Reset your dailies/weeklies whenever new ones arrive for you to work on

## Potential Features
I consider this app to be mostly feature-complete because I want to keep it as simple and easy to use as possible. That being said I could still add a few things:
-[] Add timers based on daily/weekly reset
-[] Online data persistence
